trabatar
========

A simple Java program to share a modern computer's keyboard and mouse with a
classic Mac over an ADB connection. This lets you control your old Mac
sitting next to your main computer without keeping two sets of input
devices around.

The hardware required for this connection is
[trabular](https://github.com/saybur/trabular).  Please see that project
for information about what you need to create to make this work.

This software is written in Java, and should build and run on any platform with
JavaSE 1.8 or newer. The excellent [jSerialComm](https://fazecast.github.io/jSerialComm/)
library is used to provide cross-platform serial port access to the hardware.

This is in an early stage of development and will change significantly.
More documentation will be added soon.  Any feedback is appreciated.
